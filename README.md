# Aw-Simple-Zombie-Map-Chooser
This is a simple map chooser based off the one I made for my Ghosts server, just with converted names and msg commands. 

Installation:
Open the root folder of your Advanced Warfare game and open s1x and then add the given folder to the scripts folder.

Using:
TO use this script is simple, in game open the text chat and then type ! followed by any map name, examples-->

!outbreak
!infection
!carrier
!descent


This also adds a map restart command, the command is -->

!r or !rs

Please do not edit the top say command, all I ask is to give me credit for the script.
